//The above code is including the contents of the iostream file.

//This allows us to use cout in our program to print output on the screen.

//A valid C++ program must have the main() function. The curly braces indicate the start and the end of the function.
//The execution of code begins at this function.

//std::cout prints the content inside the quotation marks. 
//It must be followed by << followed by the format string. 
//In our example, "Hello World!" is the format string.
